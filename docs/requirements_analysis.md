# Implementation Step 1: Requirements Analysis

## Objective
Clarify the goals, functional requirements, and non-functional requirements for the Agentic Healthcare Assistant project, ensuring alignment with the capstone guidelines.

---

## 1. Review Capstone Guidelines
- Read and summarize the capstone problem statement and objectives.
- Identify the main tasks: appointment booking, medical record management, history retrieval, disease information search, UI, and evaluation.

---

## 2. Functional Requirements
- The system must:
  - Accept multi-step patient queries and decompose them into actionable sub-goals.
  - Book medical appointments based on patient intent and doctor availability.
  - Add, update, and retrieve structured/unstructured patient history.
  - Summarize past diagnoses, treatments, and alerts using LLMs.
  - Search for up-to-date disease information from trusted sources (Medline, WHO).
  - Provide a user interface (Streamlit dashboard) for patients and doctors.
  - Track appointments and display summaries of retrieved medical information.
  - Evaluate and monitor model responses and tool success.

---

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
- Security: Ensure patient data privacy and secure API integrations.
- Reliability: System should handle errors gracefully and provide fallback mechanisms.
- Scalability: Support multiple users and concurrent queries.
- Usability: UI should be intuitive for healthcare staff and patients.
- Maintainability: Modular codebase for easy updates and improvements.

## 4. Sample User Scenarios
- "Book a cardiologist appointment for my mother and summarize her last three visits."
- "Update my allergy information and find the latest treatment for asthma."
- "Show upcoming appointments and summarize new research on diabetes."

## 5. Deliverables
- Requirements specification document (this file)
- List of sample queries and scenarios for testing
- Checklist of functional and non-functional requirements

---

## 6. Next Steps
- Share requirements with stakeholders for feedback
- Finalize requirements and move to architecture design
