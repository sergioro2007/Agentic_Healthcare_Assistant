Agentic Healthcare Assistant for Medical Task 
Automation  
 
Problem scenario : 
 
In the modern digital health ecosystem, managing patient care involves a range of 
complex and interdependent tasks. These include appointment scheduling, 
maintaining patient histories, and retrieving timely disease -related information. 
Often, healthcare systems rely on siloed tools with limited automation, leading to 
inefficiencies and fragmented p atient experiences.  
 
Agentic AI systems, especially those combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with 
Retrieval -Augmented Generation (RAG), offer the potential to transform healthcare 
administration by enabling autonomous coordination of such tasks.  
  
Projec t objective:  
 
This project aims to develop an Agentic Healthcare Assistant that functions as a 
virtual medical assistant. The system will utilize Agentic AI frameworks, RAG 
pipelines, and memory modules to:  
 
• Book medical appointments: Automate slot discovery and scheduling based 
on patient intent and doctor availability  
• Manage medical records: Enable attendants to add or update 
structured/unstructured patient history  
• Retrieve medical histories: Summarize past diagnoses, treatments, and 
relevant alerts using LLMs  
• Perform medical information searches: Fetch up -to-date disease 
information using trusted external sources such as Medline and WHO  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                  
 
Steps to follow : 
This capstone is structured into two parts, covering the Agentic System Design and 
LLMOps with Streamlit UI:  
 
Part 1: Agentic Healthcare Assistant System Design  
 
 
1.  Agent Planning and Goal Decomposition  
• Use a planner to interpret multi -step patient queries  
• Break down complex requests into sequential sub -goals  
• Identify appropriate tools or APIs to fulfill each task  
 
2. Tool and Memory Setup  
• Integrate APIs for:  
• Appointment booking (Doctor Schedule API)  
• Medical history management (EHR DB or Patient DB)  
• Disease search (Web Search APIs, e.g., Bing Search, Medline)  
• Use a vector database (e.g., FAISS) to store and retrieve patient summaries  
• Configure memory modules to retain long -term patient context  
 
3. Prompt Engineering and Task Chaining  
 
• Create structured prompts tailored to each agentic sub -task 
• Design prompt chains that guide LLMs through summarization, planning, 
and action triggering  
• Incorporate patient context in prompts using memory lookups  
 
4. Agent Execution Flow (Sample Scenario)  
 
User Input:  
“My 70 -year -old father has chronic kidney disease. I want to book a nephrologist 
for him. Also, can you summarize latest treatment methods?”  
 
 
 
 
 
                                                                  
 
Agent Workflow:  
 
1. Identify patient and context  
2. Retrieve father’s medical history  
3. Query doctor calendar and book appointment  
4. Search and summarize treatment options via RAG pipeline  
 
Part 2: LLMOps (Model Evaluation, Monitoring, and Streamlit UI)  
 
6. Model Evaluation  
 
• Use QAEvalChain or equivalent to assess accuracy and relevance of 
generated summaries and search results  
• Log and analyze agent performance per module (e.g., success rate of 
bookings, response precision)  
 
7. Data Visualization and UI  
 
Build a Streamlit  dashboard that enables:  
• Patient and doctor views  
• Real -time appointment tracking  
• Summary of latest retrieved medical information  
• Evaluation metrics for model responses and tool success  
 
8. Memory and Logs Interface  
 
• Display agent memory traces and planning breakdowns  
• Include interactive elements to test different user scenarios  
• Log tool usage and success/failure across tasks
